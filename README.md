## üåü Featured Projects

### üîπ [Mathematical Foundations of Reinforcement Learning (Lang: üá™üá∏)](https://github.com/MiguelAngelLuquin/Fundamentos_Matematicos_AR_TFG)

> üìò **Final Degree Project ‚Äì Mathematics**  
> This project presents a rigorous mathematical study of **Reinforcement Learning**, focusing on the **Q-learning** algorithm. It explores **Markov Decision Processes**, Bellman equations, and convergence theory. Practical implementations include environments such as *Frozen Lake*, *Tic-Tac-Toe*, and *CartPole* using Deep Q-Networks.

**Technologies:** `Python`, `Gymnasium`, `TensorFlow`

### üîπ [Prediction of In-Hospital Mortality from the MBDS (Lang: üá™üá∏)](https://github.com/MiguelAngelLuquin/HospitalMortalityPrediction_CMBd)

> üè• **Statistical Modeling Project**  
> This project focuses on predicting **in-hospital mortality** using real anonymized data from the **Spanish MBDS** (Minimum Basic Data Set). It classifies patients into severity levels and applies logistic regression models to estimate the risk of death during hospitalization.

**Technologies:** `R`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`
